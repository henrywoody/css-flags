                    The flag of France (French: <em>drapeau fran√ßais</em>) is a tricolour flag featuring three vertical
                    bands coloured blue (hoist side), white, and red. It is known to English speakers as the French
                    Tricolour or simply the Tricolour (French: Tricolore). The Tricolour has become one of the most
                    influential flags in history, with its three-colour scheme being copied by many other nations, both
                    in Europe and the rest of the world. (Source:{" "}
