                    The flag of North Macedonia is the national flag of the Republic of North Macedonia and depicts a
                    stylized yellow sun on a red field, with eight broadening rays extending from the center to the edge
                    of the field. It was created by Miroslav Grƒçev and was adopted on 5 October 1995. The first flag of
                    the country, known as the Vergina Flag, featured the Vergina Sun, a symbol that had been discovered
                    at Aigai, the first capital and burial ground of the ancient kings of Macedon. Greece considers the
                    Vergina Sun to be a Greek symbol and imposed a year-long economic embargo in order to force the then
                    Republic of Macedonia to remove it from its flag, resulting in the current design. The new
                    eight-rayed sun represents the "new sun of Liberty" referred to in "Denes nad Makedonija", the
                    national anthem of North Macedonia. (Source:{" "}
